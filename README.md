# backend

Based on the [boilerplate](https://github.com/babel/example-node-server) for a babel node.js server. Node.js with express and using babel to allow future ES.

## usage

Run the hot-reloading server in dev:
```
$ npm run start
```

Run the tests:
```
$ npm test
```

Build and mimic running in production (heroku):
```
$ npm run build
$ npm run serve
```

Our Heroku instance has a web process that runs the above two commands to start the server.
